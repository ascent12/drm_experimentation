# DRM experimentation

This is a repository for testing some DRM/graphics related stuff. This is not
indented to be high-quality code, so keep that in mind when reading it.

It does not handle things like TTY handling, hotplugging, or even picking a
modeset configuration.  You must specify the DRM object IDs.
https://github.com/ascent12/drm_info may help in finding what the object IDs
are and what they're compatible with.
